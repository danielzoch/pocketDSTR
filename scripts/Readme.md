This folder contains the IO program used to control the Pocketbeagle DSTR robot, the command used to create
the network using hostapd, and the service file used to start that script on boot. Thus, both the dstr.py file
containing the IO and the network initiation command will both run on boot.

Special thanks to Daniyal Ansari, Dr. Joseph Morgan of the Mobile Integrated Solutions Laboratory at Texas A&M University,
everyone who helped with the project, TStar/Matt Leonard for the rights to the DSTR robot, and Cathy Wicks at Octavo for her support.
